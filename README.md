# JPaint Application

### This Application was designed and developed using Java during the Fall of 2021 for Software Engineering 350. This project utilizes Gradle for testing and building. I also implemented Object-Oriented design patterns such as the Singleton Pattern, Factory Method, Abstract Factory method, Decorator Pattern, and Observer Pattern.
