### This Application was Designed and Developed During the Fall of 2021 for SE 350 using multiple Object Oriented Design Patterns

This Desktop Application was developed using Java. This project utilizes Gradle for testing and building. I also implemented Object-Oriented design patterns such as the Singleton Pattern, Factory Method, Abstract Factory method, Decorator Pattern, and Observer Pattern.
